# Spotify tracker
This effectively plans to be a stats-fm clone, and is mainly being built for learning purposes.

## Goal
Create a functioning program that when given access to a user's spotify account can display all their data clearly to them.
I hope to have options to sort this by artist, album, the user's most played songs etc.

## How to run 
It does not currently do anything.
When functional I hope to have a user interface, to get started download all the code and then run ./gradlew run (of course this is not yet functional)
